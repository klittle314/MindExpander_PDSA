# MindExpander_PDSA
PDSA form referenced in blog post 2 April 2018.

The Plan-Do-Study-Act form in this repository is borrowed and slightly adapted from PDSA forms developed by colleagues working with the Institute for Healthcare Improvement.  In turn, the IHI forms all derive from versions originally created by Associates in Process Improvement.
